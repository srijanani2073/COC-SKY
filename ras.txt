smth ra ra rasputin lover of the russian queen, he was a cat
hopelessly devoted

time after time secrets stolen from deep inside
hungry eyesss
she can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes

she hides like a child, but sh e is always a woman to me
she ll take what you give her, as long as it is free

she can wait if she wants, she is ahead of her time

and she never gives out, and sh enever gives in, she just changes her mind
